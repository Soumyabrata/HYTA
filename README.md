# HYTA dataset

This repository contains all the images and ground-truth maps of the HYTA dataset. This dataset was first reported in the paper `Q. Li, W. Lu, J. Yang, A Hybrid Thresholding Algorithm for Cloud Detection on Ground-Based Color Images, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 2011`, and is published here with permission from the authors.

This repository contains the following:

* Input images are inside folder `images`
* Binary (2-level) ground-truth maps are inside folder `2GT`
* Ternary (3-level) ground-truth maps are inside folder `3GT`

If you are interested in using the input images and the binary ground-truth maps, please cite the following:
