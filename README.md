# HYTA dataset

This repository contains all the images and ground-truth maps of the HYTA dataset. This dataset was first reported in the paper `Li et. al, A Hybrid Thresholding Algorithm for Cloud Detection on Ground-Based Color Images, Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 2011.` It contains the following:

* Input images
* Binary (2-level) ground-truth maps
* 3-level ground-truth maps

If you are interested in using the input images and the binary ground-truth maps, please cite the following:
